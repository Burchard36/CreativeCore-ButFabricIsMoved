# Why?

Creative core is used by rather a lot of useful and cool mods, it also provides a package `net.fabricmc.api`, this is just 2 structure classes really
and don't even pertain to fabric at all (The classes are just copy/pasted into the project), these packages could really just be refactored into
the base project, but according to other various issues (Mainly from this: https://github.com/CreativeMD/CreativeCore/issues/187) but other
mods have issues reguarding CC and CC itself also has a few other issues reguarding this library

Not a jab at the author who wrote this plugin, I just found it easier for all of the mods I was using in my pack to just simply move the packages
as creative core is used by many many plugins I am using in my modpack, this issue also exists in other core mods (Macaws, Glodium are some examples)
but as stated, its just easier for creative core to move these packages away... after all this is forge soooo why is fabric here XD
